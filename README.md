## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd project-name`
3. If you use SASS, compile the SCSS files: `sass src/styles/main.scss style.css`
4. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Improvements for the Future

- Refactor card components into reusable partials for better maintainability.
- Add smooth mobile-first animation transitions using CSS transitions or animations.
- Expand JavaScript logic for interactive features, such as card flipping or expanding on click.
